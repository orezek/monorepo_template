# Monorepo Walking Skeleton (v1.0.5)

A robust, minimal foundation for scalable Node.js applications. This repository serves as a "walking skeleton"—a tiny, fully functional vertical slice of a system that proves the architecture is sound.

It comes pre-configured with a comprehensive suite of modern tooling to ensure code quality, consistency, and developer ergonomics from day one.

## 🛠 Architecture & Design Decisions

This repository is not just a collection of files; it is an opinionated engineering system. Below is the breakdown of the technology choices, why they were selected, and how they contribute to stability.

### 1. The Monorepo Engine

- **Runtime:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24+)
- _Why:_ The industry standard for server-side JavaScript. We enforce version consistency via `.node-version` and `fnm`.

- **Package Manager:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (with Workspaces & Catalogs)
- _Why:_ `pnpm` is significantly faster and more disk-efficient than npm/yarn due to its content-addressable store.
- _Feature:_ **Catalogs** are used in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to define external dependencies (like `react`, `zod`, `typescript`) in _one place_. This guarantees that every app in the repo uses the exact same version of a library, preventing "version drift" and "phantom dependency" bugs.

- **Build System:** [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)
- _Why:_ As the repo grows, building everything takes too long. Turbo provides **Smart Caching**. If you only touch `apps/web`, Turbo knows it doesn't need to rebuild `apps/docs`.
- _Config:_ Defined in `turbo.json`, it handles task orchestration (e.g., "Build libraries before building apps").

### 2. Code Quality & Consistency

- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- _Why:_ Static typing eliminates an entire class of runtime errors.
- _Implementation:_ Centralized configuration via `@repo/typescript-config`.

- **Linter:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (Flat Config)
- _Why:_ Catches logic errors and bad patterns before execution.
- _Implementation:_ We use the modern "Flat Config" system. Rules are layered: `base` rules apply to everything, `react` rules extend base, and `next` rules extend react.

- **Formatter:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- _Why:_ Ends arguments about code style (semicolons, indentation). Prettier formats on save/commit.

- **VCS Enforcement:** [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) + [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
- _Why:_ Quality tools are useless if developers can bypass them. Husky runs scripts _before_ you commit or push to ensure the code meets standards.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: We use strict version management. Install [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (Fast Node Manager).

```bash
fnm use
# If not installed, fnm will prompt to install Node v24.6.0

```

2. **pnpm**:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install

```

3. **Docker** (optional for now): Planned for workshop deployment modules. Current Docker files are placeholders and are not yet wired for runnable services.

### Common Commands

| Command            | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`         | Starts the development server for all apps.           |
| `pnpm build`       | Builds all apps and packages using Turbo caching.     |
| `pnpm lint`        | Runs ESLint across the entire monorepo.               |
| `pnpm format`      | Formats all files using Prettier.                     |
| `pnpm check-types` | Runs TypeScript type checking without emitting files. |

## 🤖 AI & Engineering Standards

We strictly enforce architectural patterns. To ensure AI assistants (like Cursor, WebStorm AI, or GitHub Copilot) generate code that adheres to our standards—such as using `pnpm` catalogs and specific TypeScript configurations—we have codified our rules.

**Location:** `.aiassistant/rules/monorepo.md`

### How to use with WebStorm

1. It is enabled by default
2. For other IDE's read their documentation
3. Link to WebStorm docs: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/configure-project-rules.html

## 📐 Shared Internal Packages

To maintain consistency, configuration is not duplicated in every app. It is imported from `packages/`.

### 1. TypeScript (`@repo/typescript-config`)

We do not use a single `tsconfig.json`. We use specialized base configs depending on the execution environment:

- `base.json`: The strict foundation (ES2022, strict mode).
- `node-lib.json`: For backend packages (Uses `NodeNext` modules, no DOM).
- `react-library.json`: For UI libraries (Includes DOM, strict React types).
- `nextjs.json`: Optimized for Next.js apps (Preserves JSX for SWC).

### 2. ESLint (`@repo/eslint-config`)

We use **ESLint Flat Config**.

- **Base:** Standard JS/TS rules + Turbo cache safety checks (ensures env vars are declared).
- **React Internal:** Enforces Hooks rules and accessibility.
- **Next.js:** Core Web Vitals and App Router best practices.

## 🛠 Engineering Workflow: GitFlow & SemVer

This repository moves beyond simple script execution to a professional, predictable engineering workflow. We strictly enforce **GitFlow** for branching and **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** for releases.

### 1. The Core Branches

- **`main`**: **Production-ready code.** Every commit here is a stable release tagged with a version (e.g., `v1.0.0`). Direct commits are blocked.
- **`develop`**: **Integration branch.** The daily "current state" of development. All features merge here first.

### 2. The Development Cycle

**Phase 1: Feature Work**

1. **Sync:** `git checkout develop && git pull`
2. **Branch:** Create a descriptively named branch.

- `feat/auth-login`
- `bugfix/fix-header-alignment`
- `chore/update-deps`

3. **Work & Commit:**

- We use **Conventional Commits**.
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Example: `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle`
- _Enforcement:_ `commit-msg` hook validates your message against the standard.

4. **Push:**

- _Enforcement:_ `pre-push` hook validates your branch name. You cannot push a branch named `temp` or `my-stuff`. It must match the regex (e.g., `feat/*`, `bugfix/*`).

5. **PR:** Open a Pull Request to merge into `develop`.

**Phase 2: The Release (The SemVer Moment)**
When `develop` is ready for a release:

1. Create `release/v1.1.0` from `develop`.
2. Perform final polish (docs, version bumps). No new features.
3. Merge `release/v1.1.0` → `main`.
4. Tag `main` with `v1.1.0`.

- _Enforcement:_ GitHub Ruleset `protectSemVerTags` prevents deleting or moving tags once pushed.

5. Merge `release/v1.1.0` back into `develop` to ensure it has the version bump.

**Phase 3: Hotfixes**
Critical production bugs skip `develop`.

1. Branch `hotfix/v1.1.1` from `main`.
2. Fix and Merge to both `main` and `develop`.

### Automated Enforcement

This workflow is not just a suggestion; it is enforced via code and configuration:

1. **Husky Pre-Push Hook**: Blocks pushes from branches that do not adhere to naming conventions (`feat/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/vX.Y.Z`, `chore/*`).
2. **Commitlint**: Blocks commits that do not follow Conventional Commits.
3. **GitHub Rulesets**:

- **Protect Main:** Requires PRs, blocks direct pushes, blocks force pushes.
- **Protect Develop:** Requires PRs, blocks direct pushes.
- **Protect Tags:** Prevents deletion/updates of `v*` tags to ensure immutable release history.

## 🏗️ Docker & Deployment

### Turbo Prune

Deploying a monorepo can lead to bloated Docker images. `turbo prune` is the target approach we will use in the Docker workshop module.

### Current Docker Status

Docker files are placeholders at this stage:

- `docker-compose.yml` currently defines no runnable services.
- `apps/app-template/Dockerfile` is intentionally empty.

Use local `pnpm` commands for development and validation until Docker modules are added.

## 🧩 Adding New Components

### Creating a New App

1. From repo root, scaffold from the template: `pnpm scaffold <app-name>`.
2. Validate the new app:
   - `pnpm -C apps/<app-name> lint`
   - `pnpm -C apps/<app-name> check-types`
   - `pnpm -C apps/<app-name> build`
3. Update app-specific files (`README.md`, `.env`, and `src/app.ts`) as needed.
4. Use manual copy only as fallback when scaffold is unavailable (see `apps/README.md`).

### Creating a New Package

1. Create folder in `packages/`.
2. Name it with the scope `@repo/package-name`.
3. Extend `node-lib.json` or `react-library.json` depending on the use case.
4. Run `pnpm install`.
